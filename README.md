A simple and fun **Tic Tac Toe game** developed in **Java for Android**.  
This project was built to enhance my understanding of basic game logic, input handling, and Android development using **Android Studio**.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔁 Player Switching & Winner Detection
- Efficient **if–else logic** handles *turn switching* between Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O).  
- Automatically detects a **winning player** or a **draw** when the board is full.

### ✅ Live Username Verification
- The game **won’t start** until both *Player 1 and Player 2* enter their names.  
- Prevents empty usernames and ensures a smoother start to gameplay.

### 🔄 Game Reset Button
- A reset feature allows players to **restart the game anytime**—after a win, draw, or by choice.  
- Clears the existing board and reinitializes the logic *without restarting the app*.

### 🛡 Secure Game End Handling
- All grid buttons are **disabled once the game ends** to prevent further moves.  
- Ensures **fair play** and blocks post-game interaction until reset.
